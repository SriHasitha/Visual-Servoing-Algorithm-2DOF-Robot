# Visual-Servoing-Algorithm-2DOF-Robot
This repository contains the implementation of a visual servoing algorithm for controlling a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) robot using visual feedback. The project aims to achieve precise and robust control of the robot's end-effector position based on visual information from a camera.
