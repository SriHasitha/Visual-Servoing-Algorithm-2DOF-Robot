# Visual-Servoing-Algorithm-2DOF-Robot

**Note: This repo is currently under development and updates are in progress. Please note that the code and documentation are actively being updated. Thanks for understanding.**

This repository contains the implementation of a visual servoing algorithm for controlling a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) robot using visual feedback. The project aims to achieve precise and robust control of the robot's end-effector position based on visual information from a camera.

**Features**
- Implements a visual servoing algorithm for controlling a 2DOF robot
- Utilizes computer vision techniques for object tracking and pose estimation
- Supports integration with ROS (Robot Operating System) for robot control and communication
- Provides simulation environments and example scripts for testing and evaluation
- Includes visualization tools for monitoring the robot's pose and trajectory
